# Levenshtein Distance Explanation

Levenshtein Distance is a measure of the difference between two sequences. It's particularly used to quantify how dissimilar two strings are by counting the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other. The operations considered are insertions, deletions, and substitutions.

## Objective
To determine the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform one string (`str1`) into another (`str2`).

## Edit Operations
1. **Insertion:** Add a new character.
2. **Deletion:** Remove an existing character.
3. **Substitution:** Replace one character with another.

## Approach
- **Recursive Strategy:** Compare characters from the end of the strings. If they differ, consider the possible operations and choose the path with the minimum cost.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Use a 2D array to remember previous results, avoiding recalculating the same scenarios.

## Example

### Input
- `str1 = "abc"`
- `str2 = "yabd"`

### Output
- `2` (One insertion and one substitution)

## Detailed Walkthrough

1. **Initialization:** Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance to convert the first `i` characters of `str1` to the first `j` characters of `str2`.

2. **Base Cases:** 
   - If `str1` is empty, the distance is the length of `str2` (all insertions).
   - If `str2` is empty, the distance is the length of `str1` (all deletions).

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - Iterate over `str1` and `str2`, comparing characters.
   - If characters at the current position are the same, no operation is needed; copy the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If they differ, find the minimum among insertion, deletion, and substitution, and add 1.

4. **Result:** The value at `dp[len(str1)][len(str2)]` gives the minimum number of operations required.

## Conclusion
The Levenshtein Distance algorithm is a powerful tool for string comparison and has applications in various fields, including text analysis, bioinformatics, and more. By using dynamic programming, the algorithm achieves efficient performance, making it suitable for practical use cases.
